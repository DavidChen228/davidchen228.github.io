### CPSC 120


* Lab 1


Lab 1 is probably the most special lab to me because its like a starting point for me.
it made me realize that I have the power to print Hello World. and by the moment I see myself doing that, I believed in myself in coding and understanding in Cpp.


* Lab 6 part 2


Lab 6 is the probably my second favorite lab becaues its where you actually get to make a mini game about poker. I find this lab actually fun and entertaining to work on because you can actually win or lose.


* lab 2 part 2


I found this lab quite special and new for me because its the first time for me to allow computer using human input to process your result. it helped me understand how cin work and giving a better understanding in Cpp.
